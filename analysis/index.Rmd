## This "site"...
Is a rough collection of riffs that may or may not become parts of songs in a potential album.  It is a "place" to work and share, **but most definitely itself a communications tool**.  

## We're excited
We have data from hundreds of ecosystem models, and dozens of datasets mapping vegetation and fire characteristics to mine and explore.  Each of the datasets labels over 9 billion pixels for the lower 48 states alone.  

How can we connect emergent findings from these datasets to people who need to know?

## Warnings

* Some terms are hard to define clearly.  For example, "Historical".  We do not model a specific year, but instead try to capture the disturbance dynamics just prior to major European colonization.  This is part of the beauty of the models--not a single snapshot, but more of a window.

* These are not final products, and have not been fully annotated.   

* If you are a perfectionist close your eyes.  Font sizes and families are inconsistent.

* While we are HAPPY *happy* **happy** to address data issues and questions ("what the why is Oklahoma red?"), we'd like to focus on potential stories, audiences and ways to connect first, *if possible*.  

* Regarding those questions, I feel that annotations and stories are the way to address "surprises", and yes we need to make sure there are ZERO errors.  There may be knowledge gaps, or we may disagree, but we do not want to have blunders or mistakes.


## Blah blah blah

LANDFIRE produces and delivers more than 2 dozen spatial datasets and 900+ ecological models.  Our hope is to empower conservationists who are working to restore/adapt/"resilionate" fire adapted ecosystems in the United States through development of maps, graphs and text.

Celeste Basken is working on a scrolling document that will primarily be used within The Nature Conservancy.

The [Conservation Data Lab](https://rswaty.github.io/TheCDL/) provided valuable code and initial review.  

**This "website" is more of a workbook.  It contains code, data and charts.  NOT a final product...used as collaborative coding tool and way to showcase interactivity.**


**THIS does NOT address any type of conversion from "natural" (forest to forest) and agricultural**

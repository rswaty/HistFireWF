## This "site"...
Is a rough collection of riffs that may or may not become parts of songs in a potential album.  It is a "place" to work and share, **but most definitely itself a communications tool**.  

Some terms are hard to define clearly.  For example, "Historical".  We do not model a specific year, but instead try to capture the disturbance dynamics just prior to major European colonization.

These are not final products, and have not been fully annotated.  



## Blah blah blah

LANDFIRE produces and delivers more than 2 dozen spatial datasets and 900+ ecological models.  Our hope is to empower conservationists who are working to restore/adapt/"resilionate" fire adapted ecosystems in the United States through development of maps, graphs and text.

Celeste Basken is working on a scrolling document that will primarily be used within The Nature Conservancy.

The [Conservation Data Lab](https://rswaty.github.io/TheCDL/) provided valuable code and initial review.  

**This "website" is more of a workbook.  It contains code, data and charts.  NOT a final product...used as collaborative coding tool and way to showcase interactivity.**


**THIS does NOT address any type of conversion from "natural" (forest to forest) and agricultural**

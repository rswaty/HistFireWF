## Introduction

LANDFIRE produces and delivers more than 2 dozen spatial datasets and 900+ ecological models.  Our hope is to empower conservationists who are working to restore/adapt/"resilionate" fire adapted ecosystems in the United States through development of maps, graphs and text.

Celeste Basken is working on a scrolling document that will primarily be used within The Nature Conservancy.

A much bigger national project is brewing that is just getting off the ground.  I am hoping that our outputs will inspire brainstorming at the least, and ideally become a part of the broader national conversation.

The broader project will take many months.

## Very drafty outline for February 1st meeting with Joint Fire Science staff

1.	There was a sh*tton of fire
    * Map of fire return interval (not interactive) (if time will convert this to “historic annual probability of fire”) *in QGIS*
    * Celeste's choropleth.  *Draft complete but needs:*
        * insertion into R-Markdown
        * explanation of colors and input data
        * note that this is all fires...surface, mixed and replacement
    * Interactive horizontal bar, acres per state descending
    * Hexbins *draft complete could use:*
        * made interactive
        * insertion into R-Markdown
        * explanation (same as Celeste's Choropleth)
2.	Some ecosystems burned more than others
    * Group veg map inserted
    * Simple bar chart of acres burned by broad veg type *draft complete but needs:*
        * legend
        * color help
        * y-axis label
        * annotation to explain
    * Chord (round) *complete* chart of fire types (surface, mixed, replacement) per grouped veg
    * Sankey (left to right) chart of fire types (surface, mixed, replacement) per grouped veg
    * Historical maps of where replacement, mixed and surface fires happened the most
3.	Now
    * Animated now chart 1984-2020 just acres…no months.  Eventually have different lines for severity
4.	Then vs. now
    * Dumbbell chart
5.	(eventually?) some depiction of how many acres are needed-will be more intensive modeling effort with stakeholder input
